# Why is it called "morgenkreis" ?
(Reference: [Das Kita-Handbuch - Der Morgenkreis](https://www.kindergartenpaedagogik.de/fachartikel/beschaeftigungen-methoden/morgenkreis-ziele-durchfuehrung-sprachfoerderung/))

- A "Morgenkreis" (morning circle) is a daily ritual that provides structure, which in turn offers a sense of safety and familiarity. A regular morning circle with a consistent routine is important for providing security in the daily routine. Only when people feel safe can they relax and learn new things.


- The morning circle should be fun! It's easiest to learn when you're having fun.

### Key benefits of a "Morgenkreis"

- **It strengthens the community**: Through shared activities in the morning circle, people interact with each other, perceive one another, and experience themselves as a group.


- **It teaches social skills**: This includes listening, paying attention to each other, doing things together, and experiencing interaction.


- **It boosts self-confidence**: Taking part in the morning circle can help build a person's self-esteem.


- **It helps with knowledge transfer**: New topics and ideas can be discussed and introduced during this time.
